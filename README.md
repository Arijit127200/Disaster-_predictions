# Disaster-_predictions
## Introduction

In this project, we aim to build a model that can predict the occurrence of disasters. This involves using various machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data related to past disasters.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features related to natural disasters such as:

- Date and time of occurrence
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Magnitude (for earthquakes)
- Wind speed and pressure (for hurricanes)
- Other relevant features

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Modeling

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including but not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The performance of each model is compared to determine the best one for disaster prediction.

## Conclusion

The notebook concludes with a discussion on the best performing model and possible improvements for future work.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow (if using neural networks)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow

#Usage
